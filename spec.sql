I own a business called The Project Box. I sell project kits in bulk to organizations such as schools and camps. 
I need my bookkeeping to be organized properly. For each order I need to know the organization ordering, which project kit was ordered, 
order amount, order date, delivery date, paid or not, and the total order price. I also ask each organization how they heard aboutThe Project Box. 
After each order is processed and delivered, I follow up with a short survey about their overall satisfaction. 
The customer chooses between extremely unsatisfied,  partially satisfied, satisfied, very satisfied, and extremely satisfied. 
Be aware that not every customer completes the survey. 

Pricing and delivery time depend on the order amount.  
Orders 50 and less cost an additional $2/piece. Delivery time promised to the customer is 7 days. 
Orders between 51 and 200 pieces cost the basic price. Delivery time promised to the customer is 7 - 14 days. 
Orders between 201 and 350 pieces cost $1.50 less/piece of prices shown. Delivery time is 14 – 21 days. 
Orders over 350 pieces cost $2.25 less/piece of prices shown. Delivery time is 21 – 31 days. 


Basic Pricing:
Candy pillow kit – $5.00
Felt doll kit – $7.00
Throw blanket kit – $6.50
Felt Travel game kit – $5.50
Stuffed initial kit – $4.75
